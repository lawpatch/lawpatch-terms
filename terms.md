*Effective as at 15 September 2015*

Capitalised terms in this document are defined at the end of the document in the section entitled “Definitions”.

**Provider** means Informatio Pty Ltd (92 162 135 864), a company incorporated in Australia.

**User** means You.

## Introduction to terms

You agree to the Terms by using the Interface.

## Interface

The Interface is operated by Provider (and other entities granted permission by Provider). The Interface provides access to “open source” legal language hosted on https://github.com, for incorporation by reference into legal agreements.

## User agrees to the Terms

By using the Interface, User agrees to be bound by the Terms. If User does not agree with any part of the Terms, User must stop using the Interface immediately.

## Conditions of Use

Provider grants User a limited and revocable license to view and use the Interface if User:
- agrees not take any of the Legal Information on the Interface as legal advice;
- complies with the Terms;
- is over the age of 18 years;
- is capable of forming binding contracts;
- is not breaking any law by accessing and using the Interface (by reference to laws in User’s jurisdiction and Provider’s); and
- uses the Interface only in the way that it is designed to be used.

Provider may at its sole and absolute discretion immediately revoke the licence to use the Interface if User breaches any of the conditions above.

## Errors

User agrees and acknowledges that there may be technical or administrative errors in the information on the Interface, including but not limited to errors in the Legal Information.

## Changes by Provider

Provider reserves the right to do any of the following, at its sole and absolute discretion, without notice:
- correct any errors; or
- change the Interface or Content in any way.

## Content on the Interface

- All Content is for informational purposes only, and is to be used, incorporated or relied on at User’s own risk.
- User agrees and acknowledges that there may be technical or administrative errors in the Content. Provider makes no warranty or representations as to the accuracy of the Content.
- Provider reserves the right to correct any errors in the Content and on the Interface without any notice to User.

## Provider not responsible for user generated content

Provider makes no warranties as to the accuracy of any User Generated Content, and will accept no liability for errors or omissions in general.

## Third Party Websites

- The Interface may contain hyperlinks, images, banners, information from Third Parties. User consents to receiving this information as part of User’s use of the Interface. Provider is not responsible for any information transmitted by Third Parties.
- The inclusion of any Third Party link does not imply any endorsement or recommendation of a linked website by Provider. Those websites are not operated by Provider, and Provider is not responsible for the contents of any linked website. This Interface provides those Third Party links to User for User’s convenience only.
- User’s link to any Third Party website, or decision to accept any Third Party offer, is entirely at User’s own risk.

## Complaints about the Interface

- In the event of a dispute with another user, User agrees to work in good faith to resolve the dispute. Provider accepts no liability for disputes between users, and User agrees and acknowledges that any such dispute is to be resolved by users amongst themselves directly, without the involvement of Provider in any way whatsoever.
- If User has a complaint in connection with the Interface for which User considers that Provider is liable User must report it in writing to Provider within 10 days of the circumstances giving rise to the complaint first occurring. Provider may or may not, at its sole discretion, investigate User’s complaint, depending on the nature of the complaint.
- If User is not satisfied with Provider’s action in relation to a complaint, User must formally notify Provider of User’s complaint with a written notice which includes, or is accompanied by, full and detailed particulars of the complaint.
- Within 10 days after such a notice is given, a representative of Provider will respond to the Complaint Notice in writing.
- In accordance with this section, and to the fullest extent available under the law, User agrees not to bring any court or tribunal proceedings against Provider in respect of any complaint unless User complies with the requirements of this clause (but subject always to any rights User may have under the _Competition and Consumer Act_ 2010 (Cth) or any equivalent legislation).

## Limitations, exclusions and indemnities subject to the law

All limitations, exclusions and indemnities in the Terms are subject to Non Excludable Conditions to the extent of any inconsistency, and apply to the fullest extent permissible by the law.

## Risk

User acknowledges and agrees that User uses the Interface at User’s own risk. Provider is not responsible for the conduct or activities of any other user of the Interface.

## Exclusion of express warranties

Subject to the Non Excludable Conditions, Provider makes no warranties or guarantees, implied or express:
- that the Interface will be accessible at all times, uninterrupted or error free;
- that the Interface is without bugs or viruses;
- that the Interface is without faulty information;
- that the Interface is immune to unauthorised access or security breach; and
- in respect of the retention of, or continued accessibility of, any Content.

## Exclusion of implied conditions

To the fullest extent available under the law, Provider excludes all implied guarantees, conditions and warranties from the Terms and the Interface, except any Non Excludable Condition.

## Limitation of liability

Provider excludes all other liability to User for any Costs, including Consequential Loss, suffered or incurred directly or indirectly by User in connection with the Terms or the Interface, including in connection with:
- the Interface being inaccessible to User for any reason;
- any Legal Information being inaccessible to User for any reason;
- incorrect or corrupt data, lost data, or any data inputs or outputs of the Interface;
- computer virus, trojan and other malware in connection with the Interface;
- failure of any third party software or hosting including, without limitation, Github.com;
- User’s use of or reliance on the Interface for a purpose other than the business purposes of User or the reasonably expected purpose of the Interface;
- any loss in relation to User’s dealings with Third Parties;
- Provider’s breach of the Terms;
- any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly from the use of the Interface;
- any act or omission of Provider.

The foregoing limitation applies however the Costs are caused whether they arise in contract, tort (including by Provider’s negligence), or under statute.

## Operation of compulsory conditions

Where a Non Excludable Condition is deemed to apply, to the fullest extent possible under the law, Provider limits its liability for any breach to:
- in the case of goods:
	- the re-supply of the goods or payment of the cost of the re-supply of the goods; or
	- the replacement or repair of the goods or payment of the cost of replacement or repair of the goods; and
- in the case of services:
	- the re-supply of the services affected by the breach; or
	- the payment of the cost of such re-supply of the services.

## General indemnity

User indemnifies the Indemnified against all Costs suffered or incurred by the Indemnified, however caused, arising wholly or partially, directly or indirectly, in connection with the Terms or User’s use of the Interface.

## Specific indemnities

Without limiting the generality of the section entitled “General indemnity” in the Terms, User indemnifies the Indemnified against any Costs arising directly or indirectly from:
- User’s breach of the Terms;
- User’s breach of any warranty in relation to User Generated Content;
- User or any authorised user's infringement of any third party Intellectual Property Rights while using the Interface;
- any harm to or claim by a third party arising directly or indirectly from User’s use of the Interface;
- any negligent or unlawful act or omission by User in connection with the Interface;
- a contract in force between User and a third party connected with the Interface; or
- Provider’s enforcement of its rights in connection with the Terms, including legal costs on a full indemnity basis.

## Termination

- Either User or Provider may end the agreement arising from the Terms immediately for any reason by giving the other party written notice.
- Where the Terms have been terminated User must immediately cease to use the Interface and delete it.
- Termination of the Terms does not affect the parties’ rights in respect of periods before the termination of the agreement.
- After termination, Provider will continue to have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor User Generated Content on the Interface, to determine compliance with the Terms and any other operating rules established by Provider.

## Communications

- Communications must be in writing.
- Either party may serve any Communication on the other party by sending it to that party’s email address. A Communication by email will be taken to have been received by the addressee 24 hours after the email was sent, unless the party sending the email knows or reasonably ought to suspect that the email was not delivered to the addressee's domain specified in the email address.

## Amendment

Provider may amend the Terms at its sole and absolute discretion. Owing to the lack of collection of information about the User in the majority of use cases, Provider will not have the ability to notify User of changes to the Terms, and it will be User’s responsibility to regularly check the Terms linked to from http://lawpatch.org. By continuing to use the Interface after an amendment to the Terms, User agrees to be bound by the Terms as amended.

## Relationship of parties

The relationship between Provider and User under any Terms does not form a joint venture or partnership.

## Assignment and novation

- User cannot assign, novate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under the Terms without the prior written consent of Provider.
- Provider may assign, novate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under any Terms to a third party without notice to, or the prior consent of, User, but if Provider requires, User will sign any documents to give effect to an assignment, novation or transfer by Provider under this clause.

## Governing law

The laws of the state of Victoria, Australia govern the Terms and each party submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.

## Sensible boilerplate

The parties agree to the terms and conditions in the version of the text at https://github.com/lawpatch/au-boilerplate/blob/6427e383295cf3319eebe6df86dece3e2dc51783/sensible-boilerplate.md only (not to any amendments).

- a reference to any party includes that party's executors, administrators, successors and permitted assigns, including any person taking by way of novation and, in the case of a trustee, includes any substituted or additional trustee;
- an obligation or liability assumed by, or a right conferred on 2 or more parties binds or benefits all of them jointly and each of them severally;
